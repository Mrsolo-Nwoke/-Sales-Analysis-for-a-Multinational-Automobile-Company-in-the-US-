# -Sales-Analysis-for-a-Multinational-Automobile-Company-in-the-US-
This data science research project  Analyses and presents the sales performance of a Multinational Automobile Company  Based in the United States. 


## Project Overview

This data science research project  Analyses and presents the sales performance of a Multinational Automobile Company  Based in the United States. 

The company’s sales transaction data generated over the past years was used for this  analysis.


The objective of the study is to analyze and identify the **Top 5 Most-Profitable States for the Bike Product Category in the United States**, offering critical business insights into regional sales dynamics, and strategic growth opportunities.


Leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, including data preprocessing, aggregation, and visualization, this project uncovers key patterns in regional sales dynamics across diverse markets. 


By ranking the States based on total profit generated, the analysis empowers business stakeholders with actionable intelligence to optimize regional sales management, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance profitability in a globally competitive landscape.

Reading the Raw Dataset which originally existed as a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

```python
# solution

import pandas as pd 


bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/user/Downloads/bikes.csv")
bikes_df.head() 
```

**2.Handling Missing values**:
  
```python
# solution 

# finding out the most popular value in the product color column (column containing text)

bikes_df["ProductColor"].mode()
```
<img width="349" height="59" alt="proj2 handling missing value" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8ed4870-b7ad-4392-b60d-bb3674fd0f29" />

len(bikes_df)

# This shows that there was NO duplicates on our dataset
```
<img width="446" height="146" alt="proj2 handling duplicates" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/736f23ed-a7f9-4f8f-87a9-e0f52696f795" />


### Data Modification

```python
# generating some core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, which would be required for the purpose of the data analysis

# solution 

# (1) TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# (2) SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# (3) Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)


bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"]  - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


# Displaying the result

bikes_df.head()
```
<img width="867" height="206" alt="proj2 data modification" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de1519bc-c516-4aac-ad53-4e3752804959" />

### Data Filtering

```python
# Filtering out the required datasat (a subset data) for the analysis

# Total Profits generated by States in the US

# logical condition 1

is_usa = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"

# logical condition 2

is_bikes = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"

bikes_data_usa = bikes_df[(is_usa ) & (is_bikes)]

bikes_data_usa
```

### Data Aggregation

```python
# Computing/ Aggregating the sales data to show Total profit by State. 

# solution 
total_profit_by_state_bike_usa = bikes_data_usa.groupby(["CustomerState", "CustomerCountry"])["Profit"].sum().reset_index()
total_profit_by_state_bike_usa
```

<img width="571" height="408" alt="proj2 data visualization 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34ee50ac-59cb-4eb6-8f0b-cf9550606729" />

### Data Interpretation

The Result from the data visualization above shows that **California**, **Washington**,  **Oregon**, **Florida** and **Wyoming** are the **top-5 states** generating the **highest profits** for **bike products** in the United States.

### Key Findings

---

* The analysis of bike product sales across the United States revealed that **California**, **Washington**, and **Oregon** are the top three states generating the highest profits by a significant margin.

* The top 5 most profitable states and their respective profit figures are as follows:

  | Rank | State      | Total Profit (\$) |
  | ---- | ---------- | ----------------- |
  | 1    | California | 2,247,278.04      |
  | 2    | Washington | 963,999.62        |
  | 3    | Oregon     | 457,411.67        |
  | 4    | Florida    | 3,206.34          |
  | 5    | Wyoming    | 2,868.76          |

* **California alone accounts for over \$2.2 million in profit**, contributes nearly half of the total profit from bike sales nationwide. Indicating a highly dominant market share.


* **Powerful Insight:** The combined total profit from these top 5 states accounts for **99.76% of the total profit** generated across all U.S. states for the bike product category.


* This reveals a **significant concentration of profitability**, with the remaining states contributing less than 0.24% of total profit.

* There is a **sharp drop in profit margins** between Oregon (3rd) and Florida (4th), suggesting a disparity in market performance between the top three states and the rest.

---

### Conclusions

---

* The U.S. market for the bike product is **heavily skewed**, with profitability overwhelmingly concentrated in just only five states accounting for **99.76% of the total profit** generated across all U.S. states for the bike product category.

  
* The remaining states exhibit **minimal or negligible sales impact**, indicating either very low market demand, lack of awareness, or distribution inefficiencies.


* The business is currently **over-reliant on a small subset of regions**, making it vulnerable to regional economic fluctuations or policy changes affecting those states.


* The profitability of bike products is **highly concentrated in the West Coast**, particularly in California, Washington, and Oregon.


* States like Florida and Wyoming, while making the top 5 list, generate **significantly lower profits**, indicating limited market penetration or demand.


* External factors such as **population density, cycling infrastructure, lifestyle preferences, and climate** may be influencing regional demand.

### Reconmendation

---

1. **Double Down and Strengthen Sales & Distribution in the Top 5 States**
   Allocate more resources (inventory, marketing budget, local partnerships) and Increase investment in California, Washington, and Oregon—such as to to maintain momentum ,  expand market dominance and defend market share.


2. **Investigate and Conduct Diagnostic Analysis on Low-Performing States**
   Investigate why the remaining  U.S. states contribute less than 1% of total profit. Is it due to poor distribution? Lack of infrastructure? Low demand? Use this to inform turnaround strategies.

3. **Explore Market Diversification**
   To reduce regional dependency, test and pilot tailored campaigns in new promising states with favorable cycling culture, infrastructure, or climate (e.g., Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina).


4. **Scenario Planning & Risk Management**
   Build contingency plans around the top-performing states—since any disruption in these areas could dramatically impact total profitability.

5. **Refine Product Strategy by Region**
   Consider regional customization of product offerings, pricing, or marketing based on the stark difference in performance across states.

6. **Optimize Marketing Strategy**
   Use insights from high-profit regions to craft region-specific campaigns—emphasizing outdoor lifestyle, health, and environmental benefits of biking.

7. **Monitor Trends Over Time**
   Continue to track sales and profitability metrics to identify shifting trends, seasonal patterns, and emerging markets across the country.
